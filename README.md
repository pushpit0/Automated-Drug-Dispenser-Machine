# Project Objective:
The Automated Drug Dispenser Machine (ADDM) project aims to revolutionize medication management by provide a convenient and efficient solution for dispensing prescribed medications. 
Utilizing advanced robotics and software technology, the ADDM automates the dispensing process, ensuring accuracy and reliability while minimizing the risk of human error.
Adherence to medication schedules can be challenging for many individuals, leading to suboptimal health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. The ADDM addresses this issue by offering a user-friendly interface that allows patients to easily access their medications according to their prescribed regimen.

# FEATURES OF PROJECT 
Reducing Human errors: Manual drug dispensing prone to mistakes in dosage, medication, and patient information.
Handling Inefficiencies: Time-consuming processes leading to delays in medication administration.
Increasing Safety concerns: Risk of medication mix-ups, wrong dosages, and adverse drug reactions.
Real time Inventory management issues: Difficulty in tracking medication stock levels, leading to stock outs or excess inventory.
Healthcare resource strain: Heavy reliance on personnel for dispensing tasks diverts attention from patient care.

# WORKING
# User Verification: 
  Patient will input there registered mobile number into the machine. After that an OTP will be send to Patientâ€™s number for authentication.

# Drug Dispensing:  
  After verification the prescribed medicines will be retrieved from machine storage with the help of motors.

# User Interface: 
  Healthcare professionals access the machine's interface to review prescriptions, monitor inventory, and track dispensing activities.

# Patient Pickup: 
  Once dispensed, medications are securely stored until patients retrieve them, ensuring timely and efficient medication distribution.
