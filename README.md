# Project Objective:
The Automated Drug Dispenser Machine (ADDM) project aims to revolutionize medication management by provide a convenient and efficient solution for dispensing prescribed medications. 
Utilizing advanced robotics and software technology, the ADDM automates the dispensing process, ensuring accuracy and reliability while minimizing the risk of human error.
Adherence to medication schedules can be challenging for many individuals, leading to suboptimal health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. The ADDM addresses this issue by offering a user-friendly interface that allows patients to easily access their medications according to their prescribed regimen.

# FEATURES OF PROJECT 
Reducing Human errors: Manual drug dispensing prone to mistakes in dosage, medication, and patient information.
Handling Inefficiencies: Time-consuming processes leading to delays in medication administration.
Increasing Safety concerns: Risk of medication mix-ups, wrong dosages, and adverse drug reactions.
Real time Inventory management issues: Difficulty in tracking medication stock levels, leading to stock outs or excess inventory.
Healthcare resource strain: Heavy reliance on personnel for dispensing tasks diverts attention from patient care.

# WORKING
# User Verification: 
  Patient will input there registered mobile number into the machine. After that an OTP will be send to Patient’s number for authentication.

# Drug Dispensing:  
  After verification the prescribed medicines will be retrieved from machine storage with the help of motors.

# User Interface: 
  Healthcare professionals access the machine's interface to review prescriptions, monitor inventory, and track dispensing activities.

# Patient Pickup: 
  Once dispensed, medications are securely stored until patients retrieve them, ensuring timely and efficient medication distribution.

# PROTYPE CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION

1. Prototype Creation:
   
1.1 Conceptual Design: The first step is to create a conceptual design of the automated drug dispenser machine based on the system requirements and design specifications. This includes defining the system architecture, hardware components, software modules, user interface, and communication protocols.

1.2 Hardware Selection: Selecting the necessary hardware components such as Arduino Uno microcontroller, servo motors, GSM module, display screen, keypad, and breadboard based on performance requirements, compatibility, and cost-effectiveness.

1.3 Software Development: Developing the software components, including programming the Arduino Uno microcontroller for motor control, implementing user interface functionalities for keypad and display screen interaction, integrating GSM communication for remote access, and designing data management algorithms for medication dispensing.

1.4 Integration: Integrating the hardware and software components to ensure seamless communication and functionality. This involves connecting the servo motors to the Arduino Uno, configuring the GSM module for communication, and testing the user interface with keypad and display screen.

2. Prototype Implementation:

2.1 Validation Testing: Performing validation testing to evaluate the prototype's performance against predefined criteria. This includes testing medication dispensing accuracy, user verification processes, error handling mechanisms, real-time communication via GSM, and overall system reliability.

2.2 User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Engaging stakeholders and end-users in user acceptance testing to gather feedback, assess usability, and identify areas for improvement. This involves simulating real-world scenarios, observing user interactions, and documenting user feedback and suggestions.

2.3 Refinement and Iteration: Incorporating feedback from validation testing and user acceptance testing to refine the prototype design and functionality. This may involve making adjustments to hardware configurations, software algorithms, user interface elements, and communication protocols.

2.4 Documentation: Documenting the prototype development process, including hardware specifications, software code, testing procedures, results, and user feedback. This documentation serves as a reference for future iterations, troubleshooting, and scalability.

The prototype creation/ development, and implementation phase culminate in a functional prototype of the automated drug dispenser machine that demonstrates key features, functionalities, and performance characteristics. The prototype serves as a basis for further refinement, testing, and eventual deployment in healthcare settings.
